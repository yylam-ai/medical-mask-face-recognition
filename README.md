# Medical Mask Face Recognition

This repository demonstrates the implementation of medical mask face recognition using different machine learning models. The goal is to identify whether a person is wearing a medical mask or not using logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, naive bayes, random forest, and convolutional neural network (CNN).


The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of wearing masks for public health. This project focuses on using machine learning models to recognize whether individuals are wearing medical masks in images. The implemented models cover a range of techniques, from traditional logistic regression and naive bayes to more complex models like multilayer perceptron, random forest, and CNN.

## Models

1. **[Logistic Regression](https://github.com/yylam-ai/medical-mask-face-recognition/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb):** A simple linear model used for binary classification.
2. **[Naive Bayes](https://github.com/yylam-ai/medical-mask-face-recognition/blob/main/Naive%20Bayes.ipynb):** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features.
3. **[Random Forest](https://github.com/yylam-ai/medical-mask-face-recognition/blob/main/Random%20Forest.ipynb):** An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
4. **[Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)](https://github.com/yylam-ai/medical-mask-face-recognition/blob/main/Multilayer%20Perceptron.ipynb):** A neural network with multiple layers, suitable for complex patterns.
5. **[Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](https://github.com/yylam-ai/medical-mask-face-recognition/blob/main/Convolutional%20Neural%20Network.ipynb):** A deep learning model designed to process and analyze visual data, commonly used for image recognition.
